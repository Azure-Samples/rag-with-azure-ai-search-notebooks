# Azure AI Search Demos

This repository contains many notebooks that explain how Azure AI Search works, including several showcasing how vector search works.

## Environment setup

1. Run `azd up` on [azure-search-openai-demo](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-search-openai-demo/) with GPT-4-vision enabled. This will create the necessary resources for the Azure OpenAI, Azure AI Search services, and the Computer Vision service.

2. Create a .env with these variables, with the values taken from `.azure/ENV-NAME/.env` in the azure-search-openai-demo repository.

    ```shell
    AZURE_OPENAI_SERVICE=YOUR-SERVICE-NAME
    AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_NAME=YOUR-OPENAI-DEPLOYMENT-NAME
    AZURE_OPENAI_ADA_DEPLOYMENT=YOUR-EMBED-DEPLOYMENT-NAME
    AZURE_SEARCH_SERVICE=YOUR-SEARCH-SERVICE-NAME
    AZURE_COMPUTERVISION_SERVICE=YOUR-COMPUTERVISION-SERVICE-NAME
    AZURE_TENANT_ID=YOUR-TENANT-ID
    ```

3. Login to your Azure account using the Azure CLI. Specify `--tenant-id` if you deployed that repo to a non-default tenant.

    ```shell
    azd auth login
    ```

4. Create a Python virtual environment or open the project in a container.

5. Install the requirements:

    ```shell
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
